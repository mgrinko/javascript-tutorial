# Cross-window communication

The "Same Origin" (same site) policy limits access of windows and frame to each other.

The idea is that if we have two windows open: one from `john-smith.com`, and another one is `gmail.com`, then we wouldn't want a script from `john-smith.com` to read our mail.

## Same Origin [#same-origin]

Two URLs are said to have the "same origin" if they have the same protocol, domain and port.

These URLs have the same origin:

- `http://site.com`
- `http://site.com/`
- `http://site.com/my/page.html`

These ones are not:

- `http://www.site.com` (another domain: `www.` matters)
- `http://site.org` (another domain: `.org` matters)
- `https://site.com` (another protocol: `https`)
- `http://site.com:8080` (another port: `8080`)

If we have a reference to another window (a popup or iframe), and that window comes from the same origin, then we can do everything with it.

Otherwise, we can only change its location. Please note: not *read*, but modify it, redirect it to another place. That's possible, because such action does not reveal any data. Also such windows may exchange messages. Soon about that later.

````warn header="Exclusion: subdomains may be same-origin"

There's an important exclusion in the same-origin policy.

If windows share the same second-level domain, for instance `john.site.com`, `peter.site.com` and `site.com`, and assign to `document.domain` their common second-level domain `site.com`, then limitations are removed.

In other words, all such documents (including the one from `site.com`) should have the code:

```js
document.domain = 'site.com';
```

Then they can interact without limitations.

## Managing iframes

An `<iframe>` is a two-faced beast. From one side it's a tag, just like `<script>` or `<img>`. From another side it's a window-in-window.

The embedded window has a separate `window` and `document` objects, scripts and so on.

We can access them:

- `iframe.contentWindow` is a reference to the window inside the `<iframe>`.
- `iframe.contentDocument` is a reference to the document inside it.

When we access an embedded window, the browser checks if the iframe has the same origin. If that's not so then the access to almost everything is denied.

For instance:

```html run
<iframe src="https://example.com" id="iframe"></iframe>

<script>
  iframe.onload = function() {
    // can get the reference to the inner window
    let iframeWindow = iframe.contentWindow;

    try {
      // ...but not to the document inside it
      let doc = iframe.contentDocument;
    } catch(e) {
      alert(e); // Security Error
    }

    // also can't read iframe.contentWindow.location:
    try {
      alert(iframe.contentWindow.location);
    } catch(e) {
      alert(e); // Security Error
    }

    // ...but can modify it!
    iframe.contentWindow.location = '/'; // works

    iframe.onload = null; // run this code only once
  };
</script>
```

The code above shows errors for any operations except:

- Getting the reference to the inner window `iframe.contentWindow`
- Changing its `location`.

```smart header="`iframe.onload` vs `iframe.contentWindow.onload`"
The `iframe.onload` event is actually the same as `iframe.contentWindow.onload`. It triggers when the embedded window fully loads with all resources.

...But `iframe.onload` is always available, while `iframe.contentWindow.onload` needs the same origin.
```

And here's an example with the same origin:

```html run
<iframe src="/" id="iframe"></iframe>

<script>
  iframe.onload = function() {
    // just do anything
    iframe.contentDocument.body.prepend("Hello, world!");
  };
</script>
```

### Wait until the iframe loads

When an iframe is created, it immediately has a document. But that document is different from the one that finally loads into it!

Here, look:


```html run
<iframe src="/" id="iframe"></iframe>

<script>
  let oldDoc = iframe.contentDocument;
  iframe.onload = function() {
    let newDoc = iframe.contentDocument;
*!*
    alert(oldDoc == newDoc); // false
*/!*
  };
</script>
```

That's actually a well-known pitfall for novice developers. We shouldn't work with the document immediately, because that's the *wrong document*. If we set any event handlers on it, they will be ignored.

...But the `onload` event triggers when the whole iframe with all resources is loaded. What if we want to act sooner, on `DOMContentLoaded`?

We can try to catch the moment when a new document appears, and then setup necessary handlers, like this:

```html run
<iframe src="/" id="iframe"></iframe>

<script>
  let oldDoc = iframe.contentDocument;

  // every 100 ms check if the document is the new one
  let timer = setInterval(() => {
    if (iframe.contentDocument == oldDoc) return;

    // yeah, now set handlers and do whatever we want
    clearInterval(timer);

    iframe.contentDocument.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
      iframe.contentDocument.body.prepend('Hello, world!');
    });
  }, 100);
</script>
```

Let me know in comments if you know a better solution here.

### window.frames

An alternative way to get a window object for `<iframe>` -- is to get it from the named collection  `window.frames`:

- By number: `window.frames[0]` -- the window object for the first frame in the document.
- By name: `window.frames.iframeName` -- the window object for the frame with  `name="iframeName"`.

For instance:

```html run
<iframe src="/" style="height:80px" name="win" id="iframe"></iframe>

<script>
  alert(iframe.contentWindow == frames[0]); // true
  alert(iframe.contentWindow == frames.win); // true
</script>
```

An iframe may have other iframes inside. The corresponding `window` objects form a hierarchy.

Navigation links are:

- `window.frames` -- the collection of "children" windows (for nested frames).
- `window.parent` -- the reference to the "parent" (outer) window.
- `window.top` -- the reference to the topmost parent window.

For instance:

```js run
window.frames[0].parent === window; // true
```

We can use the `top` property to check if the current document is open inside a frame or not:

```js run
if (window == top) { // current window == window.top?
  alert('The script is in the topmost window, not in a frame');
} else {
  alert('The script runs in a frame!');
}
```

### The sandbox attribute

The `sandbox` attribute allows to run untrusted content inside an `<iframe>`. It "sandboxes" the iframe by treating it as coming from another origin and forbidding certain actions.

There are many restrictions. By default, for `<iframe sandbox src="...">` all of them are applied. But if we specify them in a value of the attribute, like this: `<iframe sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups">`, then they are lifted.

In other words, an empty `"sandbox"` attribute puts the strictest limitations possible, but we can put a space-delimited list of those that we want to lift:

`allow-same-origin`
: By default `"sandbox"` forces the browser to treat the `iframe` as coming from another origin, even if it's `src` points to the same site. This option removes that feature.

`allow-top-navigation`
: Allows the `iframe` to change `parent.location`.

`allow-forms`
: Allows to submit forms from `iframe`.

`allow-scripts`
: Allows to run scripts from the `iframe`.

`allow-popups`
: Allows to `window.open` popups from the `iframe`

See [the manual](mdn:/HTML/Element/iframe) for more.

The example below demonstrates a sandboxed iframe with some JavaScript and a form. Neither one works:

[codetabs src="sandbox" height=140]


```smart
The purpose of the `"sandbox"` attribute is to add restrictions. It cannot remove them. In particular, it can't relax same-origin restrictions if the iframe comes from another origin.
```

## Cross-window messaging

The `postMessage` interface allows windows to talk to each other no matter which origin they are from.

It has two parts.

### postMessage

The window that wants to send a message calls [postMessage](mdn:api/Window.postMessage) method of the receiving window. In other words, if we want to send the message to `win`, we should call  `win.postMessage(data, targetOrigin)`.

Arguments:

`data`
: The data to send. Can be any object, the data is cloned using the "structured cloning algorithm". IE supports only strings, so we can `JSON.stringify` complex objects.

`targetOrigin`
: Allow only a window from the given origin to get the message.

The `targetOrigin` is a safety measure. If the target window comes from another origin, we can't read it's `location`. We can't be sure which site is open in it right now, the user could navigate away.

Specifying `targetOrigin` ensures that the window only receives the data if it's still at that site. Good when the data is secure.

If we don't want that check, we can set `targetOrigin` to `*`.

For instance:

```html no-beautify
<iframe src="http://example.com" name="example">

<script>
  let win = window.frames.example;

  win.postMessage("message", "http://example.com");
  // win.postMessage("message", "*");
</script>
```

### onmessage

To receive a message, the window should have a handler on the `message` event.

The event object has special properties:

`data`
: The data from `postMessage`

`origin`
: The origin of the sender, for instance `http://javascript.info`.

`source`
: The reference to the sender window. We can immediately `postMessage` back if we want.

To assign that handler, we should use `addEventListener`, a short syntax `window.onmessage` does not work.

Here's an example:

```js
window.addEventListener("message", function(event) {
  if (event.origin != 'http://javascript.info') {
    // something from an unknown domain, let's ignore it
    return;
  }

  alert( "received: " + event.data );
});
```

The full example:

[codetabs src="postmessage" height=120]

```smart header="There's no delay"
There's totally no delay between `postMessage` and the `message` event. That happens synchronously, even faster than `setTimeout(...,0)`.
```

## Summary

To call methods and access the content of another window, we should first have a reference to it.

For popups:
- `window.open` -- opens a new window and returns a reference to it,
- `window.opener` -- a reference to the opener window from a popup

For iframes:
- `window.frames` is a collection of nested window objects,
- `window.parent`, `window.top` are the references to parent and top windows,
- `iframe.contentWindow` is the window inside an `<iframe>` tag.

Then if they come from the same origin (host, port, protocol), then windows can do whatever they want with each other.

Otherwise, only possible actions are:
- Change the location of another window (write-only access).
- Post a message to it.

Exclusions are:
- Windows share the same main domain: `a.site.com` and `b.site.com`. Then setting `document.domain='site.com'` in both of them puts them into "same origin".
- If an iframe has a `sandbox` attribute, it is forcefully put into the "different origin" state, unless the `allow-same-origin` is specified in the attribute value. That can be used to run untrusted code in iframes from the same site.

The `postMessage` interface allows two windows to talk with security checks:

1. The sender calls `targetWin.postMessage(data, targetOrigin)`.
2. If `targetOrigin` is not `'*'`, then the browser checks if window `targetWin` has the URL from  `targetWin` site.
3. If it is so, then `targetWin` triggers the `message` event with special properties:
    - `origin` -- the origin of the sender window (like `http://my.site.com`)
    - `source` -- the reference to the sender window.
    - `data` -- the data, any object in everywhere except IE that supports only strings.

    We should use `addEventListener` to set the handler for this event inside the target window.
